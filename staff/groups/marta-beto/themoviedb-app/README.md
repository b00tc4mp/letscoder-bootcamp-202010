## Technical Description

The whole app is coded leveraging different languages and frameworks, such as React for the component aspect, Sass for styling and Vanilla JS to address the APIs logic and extracting the required result.
It's shown two different pilars so to speak that lies under a user's API and a movieÂ´s API. According to the response of those APIS, we will have to handle with the logic aspect to offer the results we are looking for.
The user follows a common sign up/sign in process to properly use the app and its features fully. We rely on the users API to manage this aspect, and the main component 'App' will be taking care of this process (handleing user's inputs) until the final authentication, where the user will place himself in the second main component 'Home'.
This will be where the user will have the majority of his interactions and inputs to get the results that he/she wants.
The movie API will be the main 'actor' here and the js logic behind the scenes to offer all the information for handling.
