The MARTACHISFIT web app is the tool to make the new health-concious user ease into a lifestyle change. We are happy of providing the source of knowledge in the shape of personalized diets, healthy recipes, a devoted blog full of interesting articles about the topic and even a food database for the user to look into his food (macronutrients and calories) to create a daily food record. This record will serve the purpose to make the user more concious about his/her food decisions on a daily basis.
