    "description": "Hi there!\n\nThere is my native app as a final bootcamp project\n\nHere you can register a user as an ARTIST or as a PROMOTER, do login, once you are already autneticate as an Artist you can edit your profile, add links to youtube, bandcamp, spotify, and select a profile picture also if you have some live sessions proposals you can accept or denied it. As a promoter you can also edit your profile, select a profile picture and you can search artist by genre (Rock) for example, and then submit a live petition, then you can edit the live petition if you did any mistake and you can also select a picture for the live petition, after that if the artist accepts or denies the petition you will see how the STATE of the petition change from \"pending\" Â´to \"accepted\" or \"denied\".\n\nAny doubt or question you might have don't doubt to reach me at: \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-manzano/\n\nand also Have a nice day! :)",
